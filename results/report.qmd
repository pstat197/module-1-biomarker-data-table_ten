## Abstract

Write a brief one-paragraph abstract that describes the contents of your write-up.

## Dataset

Write a brief data description, including: how data were obtained; sample characteristics; variables measured; and data preprocessing. This can be largely based on the source paper and should not exceed 1-2 paragraphs.

## Summary of published analysis

Summarize the methodology of the paper in 1-3 paragraphs. You need not explain the methods in depth as we did in class; just indicate what methods were used and how they were combined. If possible, include a diagram that depicts the methodological design. (Quarto has support for [GraphViz and Mermaid flowcharts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html).) Provide key results: the proteins selected for the classifier and the estimated accuracy.

## Findings

Summarize your findings here. I've included some subheaders in a way that seems natural to me; you can structure this section however you like.

### Impact of preprocessing and outliers

Log transformations are standard practice for ensuring data meets parametric assumptions for a number of hypothesis tests and statistical models. And reasonably, we can assume that a log-transformation was utilized for this exact reason. To confirm this hypothesis, we randomly selected three proteins, plotting their histograms which revealed strong right skews. We then applied the log-transformation and repeated this process for the same proteins, which produced normal and symmetric histograms. As a result, these data can be used in inference without any concern for assumption violations.

Aside from non-normal, skewed data, outliers are also present. To investigate patterns within the TD and ASD groups, we utilized the 1.5 IQR rule for each of the proteins. We first examined the top ten subjects with the most outliers, revealing that those in the TD group made up 70%. To get a more holistic perspective, we transitioned into looking at an aggregated sum of all outliers across groups, revealing that ASD and TD had 3334 and 3476, respectively. These results highlight the fact that while outlying protein levels in TD present as more extreme, ASD counts are more consistent.

### Methodological variations

a\) Repeat the analysis but carry out the entire selection procedure on a training partition

b\) Choose a larger number (more than ten) of top predictive proteins using each selection method

c\) Use a fuzzy intersection instead of a hard intersection to combine the sets of top predictive proteins across selection methods

The results show that the Fuzzy intersection model preforms better then both Hard intersection models. Yielding the highest ROC AUC and accuracy also improving sensitivity without losing specificity. Where the Hard intersection model has high specificity but the lowest specificity and AUC. Adding proteins to the Hard model makes the sensitivity match the Fuzzy model but reduces its specificity and AUC.

### Improved classifier

The classifier from the in class example's best performing accuracy was 0.774, taken from a panel of 5 proteins. In the analyses, we explored separate modifications to:

a\) Find a simpler panel that achieves comparable accuracy.

The benchmarked accuracy that is from the class example is 0.774, so that is what this experiment expected to replicated. Using a function that creates combinations of 2 different proteins and feeds the data into a Support Vector Machine classifier, it is shown that a 2 protein panel that consists of RELT and DERM produce classification accuracy of 0.774, which is comparable to the in class example, which utilized a 5 protein panel and a logistic regression classifier.

b\) Find an alternate panel that achieves better performing accuracy.
