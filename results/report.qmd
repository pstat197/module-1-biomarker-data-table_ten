## Abstract

Write a brief one-paragraph abstract that describes the contents of your write-up.

## Dataset

Write a brief data description, including: how data were obtained; sample characteristics; variables measured; and data preprocessing. This can be largely based on the source paper and should not exceed 1-2 paragraphs.

## Summary of published analysis

Summarize the methodology of the paper in 1-3 paragraphs. You need not explain the methods in depth as we did in class; just indicate what methods were used and how they were combined. If possible, include a diagram that depicts the methodological design. (Quarto has support for [GraphViz and Mermaid flowcharts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html).) Provide key results: the proteins selected for the classifier and the estimated accuracy.

## Findings

Summarize your findings here. I've included some subheaders in a way that seems natural to me; you can structure this section however you like.

### Impact of preprocessing and outliers

Tasks 1-2

### Methodological variations

Task 3

### Improved classifier

The classifier from the in class example's best performing accuracy was 0.774, taken from a panel of 5 proteins. In the analyses, we explored separate modifications to:

a\) Find a simpler panel that achieves comparable accuracy.

The benchmarked accuracy that is from the class example is 0.774, so that is what this experiment expected to replicated. Using a function that creates combinations of 2 different proteins and feeds the data into a Support Vector Machine classifier, it is shown that a 2 protein panel that consists of RELT and DERM produce classification accuracy of 0.774, which is comparable to the in class example, which utilized a 5 protein panel and a logistic regression classifier.

b\) Find an alternate panel that achieves better performing accuracy.
